# Learning Journal - September 2025

This journal tracks my journey as I dive back into development, documenting the challenges, discoveries, and progress along the way.

## Starting Point üöÄ

My programming foundation is in **Java** and **C++**, and some base understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** along with **Python**. My goal is to get reacquainted with **Python** and, more importantly, to build a solid, practical understanding of modern back-end and **DevOps** technologies.

## August 30, 2025 - Day 1: The Transition üêß

The first step was leaving Windows behind and setting up a dedicated development environment on Linux. I chose to go with the **Pop!_OS** distro. I'd used it before, and its out-of-the-box **NVIDIA** support made it an easy choice. It felt less like starting over and more like picking up where I left off.

I made a conscious decision to live in the **Bash terminal** for everything outside of VS Code but not before replacing the provided terminal with Tilix. Instead of relying on the GUI, I found myself using **`mv`** to refactor my initial folder structure and constantly checking my location with **`pwd`**. It felt like the right way to build good habits from day one. By the end of the day, I had the basic skeleton of the **LinkHub** project in place.

## August 31, 2025 - Day 2: Trial by Fire with Docker üê≥

Today was a deep dive, starting with an immediate roadblock. I realized my initial OS install had left me on a tiny 20GB partition in a dual-boot setup after being giving a low storage warning. Fixed it by performing a clean **reinstall of Pop!_OS** and claiming the full 500GB drive. Originally formatted the partition to **xft4** and tried to link folders after moving them to the new storage but decided it would be best to do a clean reinstall while still fresh.

With a proper foundation, I tackled **Docker**. The concept of containerization was new, and my first encounter with **YAML** for the `docker-compose.yml` file was a lesson in strict syntax. The real learning, however, came from the barrage of errors.

### Key Learnings & Reflections

* **Debugging the Full Stack:** The initial `PermissionError` when trying to run Docker Compose was a wall. It forced me to dig deep into the Linux side of things, using **`groups`** to verify my user permissions and **`systemctl`** to debug the Podman socket. It was a stark reminder that applications don't run in a vacuum; they're deeply connected to the underlying OS. üêõ

* **The Command-Line Struggle:** Sticking with **Git in the Bash terminal** was a challenge. I immediately hit the `unrelated histories` error when trying to sync with GitHub. Solving that from the command line, rather than letting an IDE handle it, felt like solving a puzzle and gave me a much clearer mental model of how local and remote repositories interact.

* **Python's "Magic" Unveiled:** I took the time to understand the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block. Realizing that these "**dunder**" names are a core language feature for creating dual-purpose scripts and libraries was an "aha!" moment. It felt like uncovering a piece of the language's essential grammar.

* **Practical Security:** The theory of security became practice today. Understanding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` wasn't just an academic exercise; it was a necessary step for writing proper HTML. Similarly, setting up a **`.env`** file and adding it to **`.gitignore`** was a practical, crucial step in learning how to handle secrets professionally.
